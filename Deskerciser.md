The original idea for the prototype was an office-chair that could double into a bench press. The "Final Prototype" figure shows that the seat will be supported by a set of legs (in the physical prototype we used 3 legs to support the seat). The seat has a strut-channel with a strut and rigid-link assembly that runs from the seat to the backrest; the strut and rigid-link was included in the prototype to provide an extra reaction force against the force applied by the user to the backrest, it also enhances the functionality of the product by allowing the backrest to be set at fixed increments.
