The original idea for the prototype was an office-chair that could double into a bench press. The "Final Prototype" figure shows that the seat will be supported by a set of legs (in the physical prototype we used 3 legs to support the seat). The backrest will be attached to the seat in a way that allows an angle of rotation of 90-degrees (from being parallel to the seat to being orthogonal to the seat). The seat has a strut-channel with a strut and rigid-link assembly that runs from the seat to the backrest. The strut slides in the strut-channel and can be fixed at set points along the strut-channel, the linkage is rigidly attached to the backrest, so that moving the strut within the channel changes the angle of the backrest. The strut and rigid-link were included in the prototype to provide an extra reaction force against the force applied by the user to the backrest, it also enhances the functionality of the product by allowing the backrest to be set at fixed increments.
