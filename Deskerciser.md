## **Deskerciser Concept**

The initial concept for the prototype was an office chair that could transform into a bench press. Based on interviews with young adults—most of whom lived in smaller spaces like apartments or dormitories and were not homeowners—we found that one of their biggest challenges was finding the time or energy to exercise after a long day of work or school. Common issues included long commutes to gyms, limited operating hours, or simply feeling too exhausted to go. 

Our product, the **Deskerciser**, is designed to directly address this issue. The core idea is a desk chair that fits seamlessly into any living space and can quickly convert into a functional gym bench, allowing the user to perform a variety of exercises. The **Deskerciser** includes features tailored for both compactness and support during workouts, making it ideal for small-space living.

## **Functionality**

The "Final Prototype Sketch" figure illustrates that the seat is supported by a set of legs (our physical prototype used three legs for this). The backrest is connected to the seat with a mechanism that allows a 90-degree rotation—ranging from parallel to orthogonal—to maintain a compact footprint. The seat includes a strut-channel with a strut and rigid-link assembly connecting to the backrest. The strut can slide within the channel and be fixed at discrete points, while the rigid-link is attached to the backrest. This setup allows the backrest angle to be adjusted and locked into place, providing additional resistance against user-applied force. A support rod is mounted to the backside of the backrest, along with a snap-fit holder that secures the rod when not in use. This rod provides reinforcement during exercises—especially bench presses—by countering the downward force and moment generated by the user. The snap-fit holder minimizes the storage footprint when the **Deskerciser** is used as a regular office chair, an essential feature for small living environments. In the CAD renders, an additional supporting leg is placed near the hinge connecting the seat and backrest. This leg, aligned with the average center of mass of a human body (approximately 10 cm below the navel), provides further stability during use. While the leg is telescopic, it increases the overall volume of the chair. In future iterations, we plan to include a snap-fit mechanism here as well to maintain the compactness of the **Deskerciser**.
